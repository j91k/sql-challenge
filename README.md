# **SQL CHALLENGE**

## **Overview**
This repository contains data engineering and analysis tasks focused on historical employee data, and various employees data. The project involves designing database tables, importing CSV data into a SQL database, and performing various data analysis queries.

## **Key Components of the Report**
Data Modeling: Look through CSV files to see which columns had relationship with one another.

Data Engineering: Create SQL table schemas for each CSV file, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. Import CSV data into corresponding SQL tables.

## **Data Analysis:**
Listed employee details such as employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
Identified employees hired in 1986 and listed their first name, last name, and hire date.
Listed department managers with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
Associated each employee with their department number, employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
