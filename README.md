#**SQL CHALLENGE**

##**Overview**
Welcome to the Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Project! This repository contains data engineering and analysis tasks focused on historical employee data from the 1980s and 1990s. The project involves designing database tables, importing CSV data into a SQL database, and performing various data analysis queries.

##**Key Components of the Report**
Data Modeling: Look through CSV files to see which columns had relationship with one another.

Data Engineering: Create SQL table schemas for each CSV file, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. Import CSV data into corresponding SQL tables.

Date Columns: Convert VARCHAR columns like birth_date and hire_date to DATE type after importing the data into SQL tables. This ensures consistency and allows for easier date-based analysis.

##**Data Analysis:**
List employee details such as employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
Identify employees hired in 1986 and list their first name, last name, and hire date.
List department managers with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
Associate each employee with their department number, employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
Filter and list employees named "Hercules" whose last names start with "B", displaying their first name, last name, and sex.
Retrieve details of employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
Retrieve details of employees in both the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List employee last names by frequency, showing how many employees share each last name in descending order.

##**Update**
Pushed ERD into PNG file, for direct view of the relationship between the columns.
